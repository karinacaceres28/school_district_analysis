analyzing  student funding and standardized test scores using Pandas

## Overview of Project
For this project, I am aiding Maria. She is the chief data scientist, tasked with preparing standardized test data used for analysis, reporting, and presentation for providing insights about performance trends and patterns. I will be assisting Maria analyze data on student funding and their standardized test scores, I will also aggregate the data and display trends in school performance.

## Results
After performing this analysis, I discovered that overall students from the data frame had a higher averaged reading score than math score. The average reading score was 72.36 and the average math score was 64.78.  The average school budget for public school was higher than the average budget for charter school. The average public school's budget was $911,195.55. The average charter school budget was $872,625.65. Montgomery High School had a larger number of students, having 2,038 students. Chang High School had the least number of students, being only 171 students. An additional analysis I believe would be worthwhile is seeing the overall reading and math scores between public and charger schools.
